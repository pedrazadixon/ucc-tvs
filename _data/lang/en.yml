aleatorios_bernoulli:
  title: Bernoulli distribution
  sumary: Bernoulli distribution, named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability q=1-p.
aleatorios_beta:
  title: Beta distribution
  sumary: Is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] parameterized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by α and β, that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution. The generalization to multiple variables is called a Dirichlet distribution.
aleatorios_normal:
  title: Normal distribution
  sumary: In probability theory, a normal (or Gaussian or Gauss or Laplace–Gauss) distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.
aleatorios_uniforme:
  title: Uniform distribution
  sumary: The continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of symmetric probability distributions. The distribution describes an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds.
prueba_chi_cuadrado_normal:
  title: Chi-squared test (normal)
  sumary: The chi-square distribution has many applications in statistical inference, for example in the chi-square test and in the estimation of variances. It is also involved in the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population and in the problem of estimating the slope of a linear regression line, when When k is large enough it is approximated by the normal distribution. The chi-square distribution plays a critical role in statistical inference. It has a considerable application both in methodology and in theory, it is used to perform the Goodness of Fit test !!
aleatorios_binomial:
  title: Binomial
  sumary: The binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome success (with probability p) or failure (with probability q = 1 − p)
aleatorios_chi_cuadrado:
  title: Chi Squared
  sumary: Chi-squared or χ2-distribution with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables. The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in construction of confidence intervals.
aleatorios_chi:
  title: Chi
  sumary: Is a continuous probability distribution. It is the distribution of the positive square root of the sum of squares of a set of independent random variables each following a standard normal distribution, or equivalently, the distribution of the Euclidean distance of the random variables from the origin. It is thus related to the chi-squared distribution by describing the distribution of the positive square roots of a variable obeying a chi-squared distribution.
aleatorios_exponencial:
  title: Exponencial
  sumary: Is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has the key property of being memoryless.
aleatorios_gamma:
  title: Gamma
  sumary: The gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-square distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution.
aleatorios_pareto:
  title: Pareto
  sumary: The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena.
aleatorios_poisson:
  title: Poisson
  sumary: Named after French mathematician Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.
aleatorios_triangular:
  title: Triangular
  sumary: In probability theory and statistics, the triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with lower limit a, upper limit b and mode c, where a < b and a ≤ c ≤ b.
prueba_chi_cuadrado_exponencial:
  title: Chi-squared test (Exponencial)
  sumary: The chi-square distribution has many applications in statistical inference, for example in the chi-square test and in the estimation of variances. It is also involved in the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population and in the problem of estimating the slope of a linear regression line, when For k = 2 the distribution is an exponential distribution. The chi-square distribution plays a critical role in statistical inference. It has a considerable application both in methodology and in theory, it is used to perform the Goodness of Fit test !!

prueba_mvc:
  title: Prueba de Medias Muestrales
  sumary: <b>Means:</b> It allows us to test hypotheses about equality of means for related samples. A population of differences with mean µD is considered, the result of subtracting the scores of the same group in two different variables or in the same variable at two different moments. <br> <b>Carianza:</b> It is the concept of regression linear, whose functionality extends. Thus, an analysis of variance makes it possible to determine, for example, if different medical treatments (that is, a group of more than two treatments) show significant differences in their results or if, on the contrary, it can be assumed that their population means do not differ. In this way, the analysis of variance makes it possible to overcome the limitations of making bilateral pairwise contrasts between all the possible treatments, which would be a poor method to determine whether a set of variables with n > 2 differ from each other. <br> <b>Runs:</b> The observed number of runs is the number of groups of observations that are above or below the comparison criteria, K. Minitab uses the comparison criteria as a value that you specify or the default mean of the observations. The number of sample runs helps determine if the sample is random.
prueba_poker:
  title: Poker Test
  sumary: This test examines the individual digits of the generated pseudo-random number. The way this test is performed is by taking decimal numbers with 5 digits at a time and classifying them as; Pair, two pairs, third, poker quintile, poker and all different. The poker test can be performed on r i numbers with three, four and five decimal places.
prueba_series:
  title: Test Series
  sumary: Series test. Measures the correlation between adjacent elements in a sequence of numbers random. The random numbers must not contain any conceivable pattern. Obviously one can conceive a large number of possible patterns between numbers, and a special test may be created to detect each particular pattern. It is not recommended or practical to do all tests to verify the reliability of the random number generator. You should compare the cost of performing these tests with the cost of resulting from generator imperfection in a current simulation project.
